              <p className="text-resort-600 mb-6">
                Founded by marketing experts with over two decades of experience in the Korean market, 
                Big Gravity was born from a simple observation: luxury hospitality brands were missing 
                significant opportunities to connect with Korean travelers due to cultural and digital barriers.
              </p>
              <p className="text-resort-600 mb-6">
                Having worked with major brands like JW Marriott, Hyatt, InterContinental, and Sheraton 
                throughout Asia Pacific, our founders recognized the potential of creating a specialized 
                agency focused on bridging this gap with authentic local expertise.
              </p>
              <p className="text-resort-600">
                Today, we're proud to be trusted by over 50 luxury resorts and lifestyle brands to amplify 
                their presence in the Korean market, driving measurable increases in bookings, engagement, 
                and brand awareness.
